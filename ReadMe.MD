# **Java & OOP Core Concepts**

## SOLID Principles

1.  Single-responsibility
2.  Open-closed
3.  Liskov substitution
4.  Interface segregation
5.  Dependency Inversion

## ***Core Concepts***

**Data Encapsulation**

-   Hiding unecessary details

**Inheritance**

 - Don't create  _deep_  inheritance hierarchies


**Polymorphism**

poly -> many, 
mor -> form 
=> A method can have many forms

e.g. Shape can have different ways of area calculation, e.g. triangle, rectangle...etc   

**Abstraction**

 - Reduce complexity

**Decoupling**

 - Reducing coupling by hiding unecessary details
